## Introduction

This post provides a guide to enabling 'gadget mode' on the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B using only a USB-C cable, without requiring a mouse, keyboard, or monitor. The setup can be completed entirely from your computer. The Raspberry Pi 4B is chosen because it is the most powerful Raspberry Pi device capable of running the 'legacy OS.' Raspberry Pi 5 cannot install the legacy OS, which simplifies the process of enabling gadget mode. While it is possible to enable gadget mode on a Raspberry Pi 5, it requires additional peripherals (mouse, keyboard, and monitor) to modify `/boot`{: .filepath } files.

- Pi 5 dwc2 overlay fails #77: <https://github.com/raspberrypi/bookworm-feedback/issues/77>

## 1. Modify `/boot`{: .filepath } files

The Raspberry Pi OS is not configured for 'USB Gadget Mode' by default. To enable it, some files in `/boot`{: .filepath } or `/bootfs`{: .filepath } must be modified.

1. Remove and reinsert the SD card into your computer if this step was not completed right after the OS installation.

   > You will see `/bootfs`{: .filepath } or `/boot`{: .filepath }, which is accessible, and `/USB Drive`{: .filepath }, which is not. This is normal on Windows, as it cannot read Linux-based file systems.
   {: .prompt-info }

    ![RPi OS Volumes](/media/20241120-raspberrypi-setup-2/rpi-os-volumes.png){: .shadow }
    _Two drives appear after the OS installation is completed on the microSD card._

2. Open the file `/bootfs/config.txt`{: .filepath } and add the following line at the end. Save and close the file.

   ```text
   [all]
   dtoverlay=dwc2
   ```
   {: file='/bootfs/config.txt' }

   > What does `dtoverlay=dwc2` mean? <br>
   **DWC2** refers to the **DesignWare USB 2.0 Core** driver. which allows the Raspberry Pi to function as a USB gadget device.
   {: .prompt-info }

3. Open the file `/bootfs/cmdline.txt`{: .filepath }, and add `modules-load=dwc2,g_ether` after `rootwait`. Save and close the file.

   ```text
   ... rootwait modules-load=dwc2,g_ether ...
   ```
   {: file='/bootfs/cmdline.txt' }

   > What does `g_ether` mean? <br>
   `g_ether` is one of several emulation modes for the Raspberry Pi when DWC2 is enabled: <br>
    - **USB Ethernet** (`g_ether`) emulates a  USB network adapter, allowing the Pi to appear as a network interface to a connected host computer.
    - **USB Serial** (`g_serial`) emulats a USB serial port.
    - **USB Mass Storage** (`g_mass_storage`) emulates a USB flash drive or storage device.
    - **HID Devices** (`g_hid`) emulates a USB keyboard, mouse, or other HID device.
   {: .prompt-info }

4. Create a file named `ssh`{: .filepath } in `/bootfs` with no extension and no contents.
   > You can create this file by renaming a text file anad removing the `.txt` extension using a text editor like VSCode.
   {: .prompt-tip }
