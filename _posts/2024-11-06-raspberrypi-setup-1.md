This issue may occur due to several reasons. Here are three methods to complete formatting the microSD card into FAT32.

#### E.2.1. Using Windows default formatter

![Default Drive Formatter](/media/20241106-raspberrypi-setup-1/format-sd-card.png)
_Drive Formatter on Windows 10_

There are two different methods to format the SD card depending on its size.

For an SD card of 32GB or less, labeled as **SDHC**, use the Windows default drive formatter:

1. Right-click the SD card drive under `This PC`{: .filepath }.
2. Select "Format".
3. Leave configurations as default but set "File system" to "FAT32". You may name your volume label. Check "Quick Format".
4. Click "Start" to begin formatting.

For SD cards larger than 32GB, labeled as **SDXC**, use a third-party SD card formatter, as the default Windows 10 formatter cannot handle it.

> SD Card Formatter from SD Card Association: <https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/>

> If you experience issues with formatting, please see Section [E.2.2](#e22-using-diskpartexe-for-advanced-formatting) or [E.2.3](#e23-using-disk-management-to-utilize-formatting-wizard).
{: .prompt-warning }

#### E.2.2. Using **diskpart.exe** for advanced formatting

![Default Formatter Error](/media/20241106-raspberrypi-setup-1/default-formatter-error.png)
_Windows formatter error_

If the SD card is corrupted or has not been used for a long time, formatting may fail. Try using advanced options with **diskpart.exe**.

1. Type `diskpart` in the search bar or in *Command Prompt* to open **diskpart.exe**.
2. Type `list disk` to see if the SD card is detected.
3. Type `select disk {number}` to select the SD card drive.
4. Type `clean` to erase all data on the card.
5. Type `list volume`.
6. Type `select volume {number}` to select the volume you want to install the OS.
7. Type `create primary partition` to create partition 1 on the volume.
8. Type `format fs=FAT32 quick` to format the card in FAT32 format as a "quick format." This sets the maximum size for the card.
9. Once formatting is complete, type `exit` to close **diskpart.exe**.

### E.2.3. Using **Disk Management** to utilize formatting wizard

If the SD card cannot create a partition on the selected volume, use this method to reinstall the volume.
