## Mathematics

The mathematics powered by [**MathJax**](https://www.mathjax.org/):

$$
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/n^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{6}
  \label{eq:series}
\end{equation}
$$

We can reference the equation as \eqref{eq:series}.

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are

$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
