## Welcome to My Tech Blog

Nothing works the first time. This blog is a space where I document my journey through the "I don't know" moments—turning questions into answers and mistakes into lessons. I created this blog to ensure that well-documented solutions are always just an internet search away whenever I face these challenges again.

Here’s what you’ll find:

- **Error Notes**: Detailed logs of problems encountered and how to solve them.
- **Step-by-Step Guides**: Clear instructions for tackling common and complex engineering challenges.
- **Study Resources**: Highlights of concepts and tools to enhance your knowledge.
- **Project Logs**: Insights from personal engineering projects.

All posts are curated with the help of **ChatGPT**, which provides additional insights and solutions to complex problems. I also conduct extensive internet research to validate and expand on the solutions. Each post includes references under the **Useful Links** section, offering verified sources, detailed concepts, and further reading. This ensures the information is accurate, reliable, and goes beyond just ChatGPT research.
